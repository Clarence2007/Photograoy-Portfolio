    <div class="about">
        <p>Hi, I’m Clarence Omotalade, a passionate photographer born and raised in Nigeria. My journey has been shaped by my love for creativity and exploration. After completing secondary school, I started my own web development company, where I built websites for local businesses. This very portfolio website is a reflection of that journey, crafted entirely by me to showcase my passion for photography.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Moving to the United States to further my education has been an exciting chapter in my life, allowing me to blend my diverse cultural background with my artistic vision. I enjoy capturing the beauty in everyday moments, often taking what seems ordinary and adding a unique twist to make it extraordinary. Whether it’s experimenting with monochromality, playing with textures, or focusing on subtle details, my goal is to create images that feel both real and thought-provoking.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For me, photography is more than just a creative outlet—it’s a way of seeing the world differently, finding inspiration in simplicity, and telling stories through my lens. Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore my work, and if you’d like to collaborate or have questions, don’t hesitate to reach out through the Contact page.</p>
